This project does not currently work, and is still in development. 

When completed, this app will function like a social media site, where users will be able to log in, comment, edit, and delete posts, while being able to use a dashboard to see and edit their posts. 

This app uses MYSQL2 and Sequelize, with express-handlebars and is deployed on Heroku using JAWSDB.
